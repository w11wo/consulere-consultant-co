          <h3>The Bee Healthy NZ Honey is successful due to its high quality product and has been growing rapidly.
            As Kapai decided to take a break, James, the new CEO started to take over. Things went wrong under his supervision.
            He wanted to be cost-effective by removing bonuses, stopping training, changing suppliers and converting the business to eBusiness but had failed drastically.
            Quality has dropped due to these changes and many customers complained. The workers hated this idea but their opinions are being rejected.
            The company is soon investigated by the government.</h3>

          <h3>Since James joined The Bee Healthy NZ Honey, he announced that he would focus on streamlining the business which means that job will be made more efficient and effective. He will also focus on reducing wastage and unnecessary cost of the organization. He wanted to cut down the cost for production by removing staff bonuses, stopping sales competition, hiring inexperienced high school and young graduates who wanted a part time to reduce money spent on salaries, training that are not related to the product and software were stopped, shifting to ebusiness and changing their existing suppliers with the lower quality one to reduce cost.

              <h3>He would force the store managers to reduce money spent on staff hours by starting to employ inexperienced high school and young university students. However, by doing this, it might be less effective as the new hired employees doesn’t understand anything. Possibilities like the inability to manage the stocks or how to serve their customers. As a result, it leads to a poor quality of work as it affects the services or products by cutting corners or making frequent mistakes that will require high repairing cost (Anserteam.com, 2017). Besides, they can have a poor customer feedback and time management skills which shows how unsatisfied the customers are as the store has only one worker and was too tired to serve them.

            <div class="solution" id="solution1">
              <h3>Rather than reducing the wages of experienced workers and hiring inexperienced students, CEO should have reviewed the pay schedules and ensure that they are in line with the trend nowadays. It means that if the employees are earning more than what would be paid for similar job at present time then try to have a constant pay rate or increase it by a little amount until it is in line with the current trend. Keeping experienced workers will improve efficiency and effectiveness since inexperienced students require further trainings and wastage of time, not including that workers will me more motivated as they can think of some ways to become more valuable by contributing more efforts leading to an increase in efficiency and effectiveness.
              <br><br>He also changed the supplier of the honey which reduces the price but also dropped the quality of the honey. The company should have been loyal to their supplier so that they could receive settlement discount as a result of their loyalty. This will reduce the production cost but will not reduce the quality of your product. They could also compare prices between suppliers and choose the one offering lowest price and best quality. This will gain back their quality and eventually the customers’ confidence back as the customers were complaining about the bad quality of your product. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the company. The customers were not satisfied with the poor customer service of the company. Thus, company should add more workers in each store so they can serve better and satisfy the customers need well.

              <h3>James tried to reduce costs by instructing his buyers to reduce supplies from their existing suppliers and start using his contacts, therefore, they could still claim that their product is coming from organic bees since 51% of honey would come from the existing suppliers who provide organic bees. Changing the current suppliers to other supplier with bad quality of ingredients (more chemical and diluted) leads to the disappointment of customer which ends up resulting in a poor financial result as dissatisfied customers requires costly support and often shares their disappointment with the whole world (Customerthink.com, 2017). <br><br>Even if this successfully made the business more efficient but major problems could arise if customers knew about this. There were comments from customers regarding the degrading quality of the product sold by the organization. Negative feedbacks were all around the social media which will be hard for the company to handle as they were claiming that their products came from organic bees when in reality, only some part of it comes from organic bees.

              <h3>The new CEO is known to be rude to his workers. He should develop a better communication by having an open communication environment and listen to employees’ suggestion once a week so that workers will be more motivated and have a sense of belonging. There will be less conflict within the organisation as the workers know that their voices are heard and respected, leading to increased productivity of the workers. In order to reduce the cost, CEO have removed the rewards and competition between workers. However, this resulted in a drop in the performance of your workers as they feel that their works are not appreciated by the company. <br><br>As a solution, he should hold a survey of what the workers want so that the rewards given are according to their wants, set goals and give rewards when workers achieve those goals, he should also praise his workers when they achieve something so that they become encouraged to work. However, he should not just tell everyone that they are doing a good job, but tell them explicitly what it is that they are doing well. The more specific you are about what it is that your employees are doing well, the more powerful the compliment will be. He also stopped the trainings which demotivated the workers. Hence, the CEO should organise the trainings and to increase efficiency, they could train groups of people at once so that they should not teach the same thing over again with another workers and they could ask the more experienced worker to coach the new ones.

              <h3>Removing bonuses, sales competition and training leads to the decline in performance of the workers since they are less motivated. The workers could also feel that their work is not acknowledged by the organization and as a result, they would reduce their inputs. Overjustification effect which states that removal of rewards lead to decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation could occur at this point. Not to mention that by removing the trainings, employees lose their opportunity to learn something new and therefore, they would be demotivated in doing their tasks. <br><br>Their own workers were also extremely angry at how their values were being forgotten so quickly when they were actually pursuing it when they first started in the company. They were complaining as well that their CEO was slacking off during work hours while he should be doing his work in his office instead. Moreover, James was rude in the eye of workers and rarely talk to them unless he has to. This leads to the anger of one worker when he decided to publicly tell that the company has been lying to customers for trying to manipulate the fact that they use cheap imported ingredients for producing so called organic honey products.

            <h1 class="theory-name" id="theory-name1">Managerial Skills</h1>
            <h3 class="theory-hide" id="theory-list1">There are three skills of manager that James Bronle, the new manager of Bee Healthy NZ Honey, should have. It is the technical skills, Human skills, and conceptual skills. Technical skill is the ability to apply the specialized procedures, techniques, and knowledge required to get the job done. Here, James Bronle has good technical skills as he used to be excellent accountant and has used his skills in accounting to evaluate the organization’s sales performance and ways to reduce unnecessary cost across the organization. However, he does not have good conceptual skills. <br><br>Conceptual skill is the ability to see organization as a whole, understand how the different parts affect each other and recognize how the company fits into or is affected by its external environment. In this case, he wanted to cut down the cost for production by removing staff bonuses, stopping sales competition, hiring inexperienced high school and young graduates who wanted a part time to reduce money spent on salaries, training that are not related to the product and software were stopped, shifting to ebusiness and changing their existing suppliers with the lower quality one to reduce cost. The thing is he lacked of conceptual skill in determining how his ways of reducing the cost could affect other different parts and even affect the productivity and quality of the products they produce. Removing bonuses, sales competition and training leads to the decline in performance of the workers since they are less motivated. Whereas hiring inexperienced workers such as new graduates of even high school students leads to another problem. <br><br>According to anserteam.com (ANSERTEAM, 2017), hiring inexperienced workers lead to poor quality of work, poor attitude towards customers, poor attendance and time management as well as poor teamwork skills. This is proved by the complaints of customers that there was only one person working and was not even bothered to serve the customer. Changing the current suppliers to other supplier with bad quality of ingredients (more chemical and diluted) leads to the disappointment of customer which ends up resulting in a poor financial result as dissatisfied customers requires costly support and often shares their disappointment with the whole world(Customerthink.com, 2017). This all clearly shows that James lacks conceptual skill as he failed to identify that the company would be badly affected by the changes he made. <br><br>Moreover, he lacks human skill which is the ability to interact with others. When workers are saying their concern and thoughts regarding the quality of the ingredients the supplier supplied to them, he completely ignores their thoughts and warning. In addition, James are rude in the eye of workers and rarely talk to them unless he has to. This clearly shows the weak human skills that James has as he doesn’t communicate well with his workers and refuses to listen to what his workers’ thoughts and advice are. This leads to the anger of one worker when he decided to publicly tell that the company has been lying to customers for trying to manipulate the fact that they use cheap imported ingredients for producing so called organic honey products. If only James has nice human skills, instead of spreading the fraud of the company in front of public, the worker would have talked to James personally about his concern.

            <h1 class="theory-name" id="theory-name2">Efficiency and Effectiveness</h1>
            <h3 class="theory-hide" id="theory-list2">The management theories that can be applied are efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency is getting work done with a minimum of effort, expense, or waste (Williams and McWilliams, 2017). Effectiveness is accomplishing tasks that help fulfill organizational objectives, such as customer service and satisfaction (Williams and McWilliams, 2017). In this case, James tried to be efficient by reducing unnecessary costs like changing the supplier and employing inexperienced high school and young university students. Changing the supplier into the ones providing poorer quality of product is indeed saving cost as they would be cheaper hence more efficient, however, effectiveness is not guaranteed as known that there were a lot of customer complaints and a downturn in customer satisfaction. James would fail in being effective even if he is efficient. <br><br>By employing inexperienced students also decreases the probability where the store would be managed as well as how it is used to be. They wouldn’t understand how to properly operate the store and leads to a decrease in effectiveness as productivity decreases. Having just one worker working in the store may not be as efficient as how we think it could be. There were a lot of things to do in the store besides serving the customer. They must clean the glass on the entry doors and front windows, sweep the front sidewalk, wipe the counters and all machines clean, counting all the stocks and many other things (Smallbusiness.chron.com, 2017). Consequently, there will be lesser time to even serve the customers and workers will be too tired, therefore, it won’t be effective.

            <h1 class="theory-name" id="theory-name3">Control</h1>
            <h3 class="theory-hide" id="theory-list3">Controlling is a process of monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance. There are three types of control which are feedforward control, concurrent control, and feedback control. Here, James lack in feedforward control and concurrent control. Feedforward control is monitoring inputs rather than outputs to prevent performance deficiencies. The inputs for the production here are workers and ingredients. However, James decided to hire inexperienced workers who don’t know how to properly treat customers and how to manage a shop. <br><br>Moreover, he switched to suppliers with bad quality of ingredients (more diluted and more chemicals) resulting in poor quality of honey produced. This means that James did not properly control the inputs for production. In addition to that, although the workers have noticed the deficiencies in the quality of the ingredients and even tried to warn James by saying their thoughts and concern, James was least bothered about it. This clearly shows that James lacked in concurrent control which is gathering performance deficiencies as they occur.

            <h1 class="theory-name" id="theory-name4">Motivation</h1>
            <h3 class="theory-hide" id="theory-list4">Motivation is a set of forces that initiates, directs, and make people persist in their efforts to accomplish goals. Here, the removal of staff’s bonuses as well as stoping the training programmes demotivates workers and thus the effort they put on their work is lessen linking to decline in the productivity of the workers. This is related to the expectancy theory. Expectancy theory (or expectancy theory of motivation) proposes an individual will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behavior over other behaviors due to what they expect the result of that selected behavior will be (Oliver, R. (August, 1974)) or that an individual will be motivated if they feel that there is a positive relation between effort and performance; which means that if the performance is favourable they will get desirable award. There are two types of awards which are extrinsic and intrinsic awards. <br><br>Extrinsic awards are tangible awards given for goal accomplishment such as bonuses. Whereas intrinsic rewards are intangible awards such as sense of accomplishment and opportunity to learn new things. Staffs bonuses are extrinsic rewards and trainings are intrinsic rewards. So with both removed, workers will be demotivated and thus there will be decline in productivity.
